# Futbol

## About:
 - Welcome to Futbol! A Mod 1 group project application that will run all sorts of statistics for the given csv files.

## Built With:
 - Ruby Version: 2.7.2p137
 - RSpec Version: 3.10

## Getting Started:
 - Fork/Clone this repo to your computer from GitHub.
  - [Futbol](https://github.com/kevingloss/futbol)

## Testing:
 - If you'd like to run through our test suite just use the rspec spec/<file_name> on any of the spec files.
 - There is also a pre-built [spec-harness](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/futbol_spec_harness) for this application.
 - We've also used SimpleCov to ensure our tests have full coverage.
  - To run the Simplecov report type the following into your terminal: open coverage/index.html
  - See details here: [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov)
 - Tests are organized to have specific tests in each of the manager files and the components are brought together in the stat_tracker.rb
  - There are tests to make sure each individual method is in working order, as well as the methods in stat_tracker that bring several together.

## Challenges & Wins
 - During this project we purposefully created everything in a single file originally. Then proceeded to refactor and break everything out.
 This provided great experience in seeing how inheritance/modules could have been used from the beginning to better organize the application.
 - As a group we were challenged by everyone initially exploring different approaches to begin the project. We were able to work through this
 by talking through the options and deciding as a group how we would like to proceed. It was also a challenge to complete all of the required
 methods and then have to refactor them into appropriate classes instead of just building them to follow SRP in the first place. We were able
 to refactor everything appropriately but it really brought to light the idea of developer empathy.
 - This experience will benefit us all in the future as we think about the best approach to setting up projects and collaborating with a team.
